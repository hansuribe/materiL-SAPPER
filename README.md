### Running the project

However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:5000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.
